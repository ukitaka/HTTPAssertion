HTTPAssertion is a Swift package that enables HTTP request assertion capabilities within XCUITest, allowing you to verify that specific HTTP requests are made during UI interactions that don't have visible UI feedback.

## Features

- üîç **HTTP Request Logging**: Automatically intercepts and logs all HTTP requests made by your app
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Assertions**: Assert requests by URL, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, and more
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Wait for Requests**: Built-in waiting functionality for asynchronous request verification
- üì± **Cross-Process Communication**: Seamless data sharing between app and test processes
- üß™ **XCUITest Integration**: Designed specifically for XCUITest workflows
- üöÄ **Swift Concurrency**: Built with modern Swift concurrency features

## Architecture

HTTPAssertion consists of two Swift Package libraries:

1. **HTTPAssertionLogging**: Used in your app to log HTTP requests
2. **HTTPAssertionTesting**: Used in your XCUITests to make assertions about those requests

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add HTTPAssertion to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ukitaka/HTTPAssertion.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Add the appropriate targets to your app and test targets:

```swift
// For your app target
.target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "HTTPAssertionLogging", package: "HTTPAssertion")
    ]
)

// For your XCUITest target
.target(
    name: "YourAppUITests",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "HTTPAssertionTesting", package: "HTTPAssertion")
    ]
)
```

## Usage

### 1. Enable HTTP Logging in Your App

Add HTTP logging to your app, typically in your App delegate or main app file:

```swift
import HTTPAssertionLogging

#if DEBUG
HTTPAssertionLogging.start()
#endif
```

For SwiftUI apps, you can add it to your main App struct:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import HTTPAssertionLogging

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    init() {
        #if DEBUG
        HTTPAssertionLogging.start()
        #endif
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Write Assertions in Your XCUITests

Import HTTPAssertionTesting in your test files and use the assertion functions:

```swift
import XCTest
import HTTPAssertionTesting

class MyAppUITests: XCTestCase {
    
    func testSearchButtonSendsAnalytics() throws {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()
        
        // Perform UI interaction
        app.buttons["Search"].tap()
        
        // Assert that the expected HTTP request was made
        HTTPAssertRequested("https://analytics.example.com/event")
    }
    
    func testLoginRequest() throws {
        let app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()
        
        app.textFields["username"].tap()
        app.textFields["username"].typeText("testuser")
        app.textFields["password"].tap()
        app.textFields["password"].typeText("password")
        app.buttons["Login"].tap()
        
        // Wait for and assert login request
        waitForRequest(
            url: "https://api.example.com/login",
            method: "POST",
            timeout: 5.0
        )
        
        HTTPAssertRequestedOnce("https://api.example.com/login")
    }
}
```

## API Reference

### HTTPAssertionLogging

#### HTTPAssertionLogging

Main class for controlling HTTP request logging:

```swift
// Start logging HTTP requests
HTTPAssertionLogging.start()

// Stop logging HTTP requests
HTTPAssertionLogging.stop()
```

#### Context

Share data between your app and tests:

```swift
// In your app
Context.store("user_id", value: "12345")

// In your tests
let userId: String? = Context.retrieve("user_id")
```

### HTTPAssertionTesting

#### Assertion Functions

```swift
// Assert that a request was made
HTTPAssertRequested("https://api.example.com/data")

// Assert that a request was NOT made
HTTPAssertNotRequested("https://api.example.com/sensitive")

// Assert that a request was made exactly once
HTTPAssertRequestedOnce("https://api.example.com/analytics")

// Get all matching requests
let requests = HTTPRequests(url: "https://api.example.com/search")
```

#### Advanced Matching

```swift
// Match by HTTP method
HTTPAssertRequested("https://api.example.com/data", method: "POST")

// Match by headers
HTTPAssertRequested(
    "https://api.example.com/data",
    headers: ["Authorization": "Bearer token123"]
)

// Match by query parameters
HTTPAssertRequested(
    "https://api.example.com/search",
    queryParameters: ["q": "swift", "limit": "10"]
)

// Use regular expressions for URL patterns
HTTPAssertRequested(urlPattern: "https://api\\.example\\.com/users/\\d+")
```

#### Waiting for Requests

```swift
// Wait for a request to be made
waitForRequest("https://api.example.com/data", timeout: 10.0)

// Wait for a response to be received
waitForResponse("https://api.example.com/data", timeout: 10.0)

// Wait with custom conditions
waitForRequest(
    urlPattern: "https://api\\.example\\.com/analytics.*",
    method: "POST",
    timeout: 5.0
)
```

## How It Works

1. **HTTP Interception**: HTTPAssertionLogging uses method swizzling to intercept `URLSessionConfiguration.default` and `URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral`, adding a custom `URLProtocol` that logs all HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Cross-Process Storage**: Request data is stored in the simulator's shared resources directory (`SIMULATOR_SHARED_RESOURCES_DIRECTORY/Library/Caches/HTTPAssertion/`) as JSON files, allowing both app and test processes to access the same data.

3. **Flexible Matching**: HTTPAssertionTesting provides powerful matching capabilities using `HTTPRequestMatcher`, supporting exact matches, regular expressions, and multiple criteria combinations.

4. **Async Support**: Built with Swift concurrency features, providing thread-safe operations and efficient async/await APIs.

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+ / macOS 12.0+
- Swift 6.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- **iOS Simulator only** (does not work on physical devices due to shared storage requirements)
